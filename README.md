# NoteEditorRPGMMV

This is a tool to use during the developement of rpg with rpgmaker.

If you are using some plugin that read the **note** section to do some stuff and you can't stand looking at the tiny box that rpgmaker give you. This is the tool you need!  
It's an early setup so if you need improvement you can create issues or pull request.

It use Qt6 and CMake, I try to only use QT for the UI stuff and the rest should be in c++ standard.
